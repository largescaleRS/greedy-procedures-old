# greedy-procedures-paper

This is the repo for the experiments in the paper: The (Surprising) Sample Optimality of Greedy Procedures for Large-Scale Ranking and Selection, which is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02951. Since the PCS or PGS is estimated based on multiple macro replications, we utilize the Ray package to parallelize the macro replications. 

The file procedures.py includes all the procedures involved. The file utils.py includes all the necessary functions.
