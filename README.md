# greedy-procedures-paper

This is the repo for the experiments in the paper: The (Surprising) Sate Optimality of Greedy Procedures for Large-Scale Ranking and Selection. Since the PCS or PGS is estimated based on multiple macro replications, we utilize the Ray package to parallelize the macro replications. 

The file procedures.py includes all the procedures involved. The file utils.py includes all the necessary functions.
